This repository contains scripts used to pull Landsat 5 satellite data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and export the resulting data to Google Drive.

Features

  Landsat 5 Data Access: Fetches Landsat 5 satellite imagery for a specific area and time range.
  
  NDVI Calculation: Computes the NDVI using the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands of Landsat 5 data.
  
  Data Export: Exports the NDVI results as GeoTIFF files to Google Drive for further analysis.

You can simply copy the code into GEE and run it. You should change the date, area and cloud cover if needed.
